# Changes Summary

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Area Creation Investigation
- Confirmed that Things.app does NOT support creating areas via URL scheme or JSON import
- Areas must be created manually in the Things.app interface
- Projects can only be assigned to existing areas

### 2. Removed Show and Search Functionality
- Removed `show` and `search` commands from `ThingsCommand` type
- Removed `ShowTarget`, `ShowParams`, and `SearchParams` interfaces
- Updated `ThingsParams` union type to exclude show/search params

### 3. Updated Integration Tests
- Removed all show/search related tests that caused "You didn't assign which list to access" errors
- Removed invalid URL test that caused annoying popup errors
- Restructured tests to follow lifecycle pattern: Create → Update → Complete
- Updated area assignment test to use "Work" area with warning message
- Added proper auth token checks for update operations
- Added edge case tests for special characters and deadlines

### 4. Test Improvements
- Tests now properly skip update/complete operations when no auth token is available
- Added informative console messages for test execution
- Maintained all URL building validation tests
- Improved test organization with descriptive test suite names

## Files Modified

1. `/src/types/things.ts` - Removed show/search types
2. `/tests/integration.test.ts` - Complete rewrite with lifecycle pattern
3. `/test-improvement-plan.md` - Created to document issues found
4. `/CHANGES.md` - This summary file

## Notes

- The integration tests now create test items but cannot automatically clean them up without real IDs from Things
- Update and complete operations require `THINGS_AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable
- Area assignment only works if the specified area already exists in Things
